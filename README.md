# Chess Player Classification

## Project Goal

By submitting a [Lichess](www.lichess.org)-username, one can check how similar the playstyle to a small group of Grandmasters is. This is a WIP and the models used are not supposed to be strong, but rather demonstrate techniques that 
can be used to achieve this.

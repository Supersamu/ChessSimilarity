# Chess Player Classification

## Project Goal

By submitting a [Lichess](https://www.lichess.org) username, one can check how similar their playstyle is to a small group of Grandmasters. This is a work in progress, and the models used are not intended to be strong, but rather to demonstrate techniques that can be used to achieve this.
